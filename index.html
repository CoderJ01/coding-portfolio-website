            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    Hello world! My name is Joshua and I am a software developer that currently works at a start-up called Tailored Software. My path as
                    a programmer began in community college when I enrolled in a C/C++ course and an assembly programming course. After taking the 
                    courses, I realized that programming would be a career that I could take seriously. Several months later I enrolled in an accredited 
                    coding boot camp.
                </p>   
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The foundational languages I learned in said boot camp are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The boot camp is designed to teach students the 
                    basics of being a full-stack developer. A full-stack developer can program frontend and backend applications and can configure 
                    databases.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    In addition to JavaScript, students are taught how to utilize APIs in frontend applications. They are also taught to use libraries 
                    such as Bootstrap and React.js. Students also learn a software architectural pattern known as model-view-controller. With regards to 
                    backend programming, students are taught rudimentary concepts and uses of Node.js, Express.js, and RESTful APIs. As for databases, 
                    students are taught both SQL and noSQL.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Given that I previously had barely any programming experience, bootcamp was a challenge. Nevertheless, I made it to the end, from 
                    month one to month six, with a cohort that dwindled to less than half its original size. After I graduated from boot camp, I 
                    practiced more with RESTful APIs on my own. I also dabbled in Python and gained a solid understanding of object-oriented programming 
                    via learning Java.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Now, as Iâ€™ve mentioned before, I work as a developer at a start-up company. For the front-end, the company primarily utilizes React.js. The primary 
                    languages for the backend are Python and GraphQL. I'm a front-end developer for the company.
                </p>
                <br/>
